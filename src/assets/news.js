      "Buying golf equipment can be like dumping money into a money pit, but armed with some knowledge you can save time and money in selecting the right clubs for yourself. As with most things in life, you can spend a lot or you can spend a little several times before you get what you really need. If you are first starting out and not completely sure you want to commit to this addictive game, you should either rent clubs at the golf course, or buy a starter set of clubs. Buying a set of starter clubs enables you to become accustomed to them; enabling you to concentrate on your swing instead of wondering how this set of mismatched clubs you just rented are going to work out. As you become better at the game, you should invest in a better set of clubs, fitted to you. Generally, a set includes a driver, one or two fairway woods, 4-9 irons, a wedge or two and perhaps a putter. As you become more experienced and start thinking about new clubs, you may want to consider buying your driver separately. Some players want a driver to give them more accuracy; some need the distance. There are numerous balls available and the box will usually have a chart on the back and direct you to the right ball for your needs. As you learn the game and get better at it, you should experiment with different balls which could improve your accuracy or distance. Having the right equipment is an important aspect of the game; buy wisely!",
